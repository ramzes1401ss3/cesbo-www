**rp_filter** - is a technique for the purposes of ensuring loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing.

<!-- more -->

If your server has several network interfaces, recommend to set routes for multicast groups. If this is not applicable and interface is defined in the source or destination address you should disable rp_filter.

Append into the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file next lines:

```
net.ipv4.conf.eth0.rp_filter = 2
```

First two line is identical for any servers. Third line is depend of the interfaces names. Append lines, like a third, for each interface and replace eth0 with the name of interfaces.

To apply changes restart system or launch:

``` sh
sysctl -p
```
