#### Format

- **XMLTV** — is a most popular format to store EPG in the files. XMLTV uses in some middlewares (Infomir Stalker for example)
- **JSON** — is a JavaScript object notation. This format useful to send EPG to the external servers or could be used directly in the web-application

#### Destination

- **file** — save EPG into the file. Astra saves only one program per file
- **http** — send EPG in the body of the POST request via HTTP protocol. On the server side should be application to process received request

#### Codepage

This option let to override EPG codepage. By the default Astra get codepage from the stream in the EIT table
