### PID - TS Packet identifier

Elementary streams (video, audio) and information tables are packed to the TS-packets. Each packet has unique identifier - PID.

<!-- more -->
PID value should be in range from 0 to 8191. Range from 0 to 31 and 8191 preallocated and shouldn't used for elementary streams. For elementary streams possible to use any PID in range from 32 to 8190.

#### How to find PID values in the stream?

- With VLC player. Play the stream, then open Tools - Media Information - Codec. The "Original ID" field contains PID value
- With Astra analyzer. Launch in console:
``` sh
astra --analyze "stream address"
```

### CBR/VBR - Bitrate

Stream bitrate has two types:

- **VBR** - variable bitrate, depends of the stream compression ratio
- **CBR** - constant bitrate, this is VBR stream stuffed with NULL-TS packets
NULL-TS packets have constant PID - 8191 and don't have payload, only zeros.

To generate CBR streams in Astra append the cbr option into the output address. Value should be in Kbit/s. For example:

`udp://239.255.1.1:1234#cbr=8000`  
Note: the **"no_sync"** option disables CBR   
For versions below 5.63 - the CBR option must be used in conjunction with the "sync" option"  

If stream bitrate higher than "cbr" value, then stream passed as is. Option works only for UDP-output. For any other formats no reason to use CBR.
