##  Access Authorization.  
Authorization allow to control an access to the channels and allow to keep a statistics of watching.

## Introduction

 Authorization allow controlling access to the channels and keeping a statistics of watching.  
 Authorization works only with HTTP and HLS protocols. In other cases, to restrict an access could be used **Stream Scrambling**.  
 
 Scripting language allow implementing many authorization schemes.   

Examples:  
The authorization schema described in the script.  
For version 5.62 and newer script could be saved in the `/etc/astra/mod` directory. For windows `C:\astra\mod`   
Script will be automatically loaded on launch. For any other version path to the script could be defined in the command line:   `astra -c /etc/astra/example.conf -p 8000 /etc/astra/auth.lua`   
On access to the channels with HTTP Play, other settings is not required. In other cases, append the auth option to the Output in the Stream settings. Example: `http://0:5000/channel-id#auth` 

Define the auth_request function in the script.:

```
function auth_request(client_id, request, callback)
    if not request then
        -- closing connection to client
        return nil
    end
    -- processing a client request
    callback(true)
end
```
The function called on a request processing and after connection closing. Function accepts three arguments:
- **client_id** — unique connection number
- **request** — table with the request information. Argument passed only on a request processing
- **callback** — function, to complete authorization, accept one argument: true - allow access, false - deny access, client get the error 403 Forbidden


## Limiting connections from a single IP address

single_ip.lua

- **limit** — limit of the connections from the single IP
- **on_start** — function, on a request processing. 
Select a list of the client identifiers client_id_list from the table ip_list by the IP address. 
If the number of the client identifiers greater than the limit value, then close a connection for the first client  
- **on_stop** — function, on connection closing. Remove client identifier from the client_id_list  


## Limiting connections by the IP addresses

limit_by_ip.lua

Description of the script:
- **access_list** — list of the IP addresses and sub-networks
- **ip_to_number** — convert IPv4 address to the 32-bit number
- **mask_to_number** — convert network mast to the 32-bit number
- **parse_access_list** — convert access_list on script launch, for better performance
- **ip_check** — check IP address


## GeoIP access restrictions

An example shows how to communicate with GeoIP service. How to allow access for customers from the specific country:  

geoip.lua

When client connected, Astra sends a request to the GeoIP service freegeoip.net. 

Description of the script:
- **allow_country** — list of the country codes ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
- **on_response** — function, processing GeoIP service response. This example grant access in next cases: Response code is not equal to 200 Ok Response not contain information about the IP The country code is not found in the allow_country auth_request — function, sends a request to http://freegeoip.net/json/Clien-IP-Address


## Integration with Stalker Middleware

In the Stalker settings turn on Temporary URL - Flussonic support  

stalker.lua

Description of the script:
- **stat_list** — table to store information about sessions: name - stream name, addr - client IP address, time - the time of start of the stream
- **auth_request** — append information about the sessions to the stat_list, on closing connection calculate the total time of the connection and write to the log if connection time greater than 1 minute


## Retrieve IP address from X-Real-IP

Method used to replace connection IP address by IP address defined in the HTTP header **X-Real-IP** or **X-Forwarded-For**

xrealip.lua


## Authorization by login/password and tokens

- Authentication by token;
- IP address validation (optional);
- Redirect to additional server;
- Limit connections for same user;
- Channels without authentication;
- Packages;
- Redirect to the promo channel.

auth.lua

Client authorization:  
**stream address?auth=admin:admin** (login and password)  
**stream address?token=112277668833743** (token)
