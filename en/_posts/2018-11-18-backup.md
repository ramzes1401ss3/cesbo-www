Sometimes it is necessary to reserve a source, or when the main source is lost, start broadcasting the screen saver. For this purpose, it is possible to use several inputes.

<!-- more -->

**Active backup** — default. immediately returns to the primary source  
**Active backup and Stop streaming if all inputs are inactive** (in previous versions was additional input: stop:)  
**Passive backup — inputs works one by one**  
**Disable - disable backup**

the list of inputs: 1-DVB adapter
2-redundant http stream
3-file with a splash screen, which reports that this channel is currently unavailable

this example shows that if the main source of the signal is lost, then immediately switch to the backup, and in the case of the main source of the signal-observe it for 300 seconds to prevent chaotic switching between sources
